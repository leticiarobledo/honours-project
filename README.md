# Honours Project: Enhanced Anomaly Detection through Deep Feature Extraction

Code implementation and plotted results of the feature extraction experiments on Deep Unsupervised Anomaly Detection method f-AnoGAN and the designed hybrid, multi-tasking architecture.

Results show improvements on state-of-the-art model on benchmark datasets SVHN, MNIST and USPS on both cross-domain and multi-task objectives. Obtained Outstanding Award on thesis evaluation.
